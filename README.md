This repository is for my personal progression on 30 Days of JavaScript -programming challenge made by [Asabeneh](https://github.com/Asabeneh/).

I will try to make diary style notes of how each day's exercises went.

I will point out things that I consider as important takeaways and things that I found hard and how I solved them.
